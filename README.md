### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.12

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. **Start with a clear research topic** ‚Äì something that already has active research.
2. **Provide specific links** (e.g., DOI URLs) if you have particular papers or queries in mind.
3. **Mention preferences** like sorting (e.g., by citations, date) or whether you want only open-access papers.
4. SAIRA will suggest **keywords** based on your intent. You can customize them if needed.
5. Once keywords are finalized, SAIRA will list **relevant topics** to choose from.
6. Select a topic, and SAIRA will fetch a curated list of research papers for you.
